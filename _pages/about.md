Hi! My name is Liuchao Jin. I'm currently pursuing a Doctor of Philosophy in Mechanical & Automation Engineering at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html). This academic journey is guided by Prof. [Wei-Hsin Liao](https://www4.mae.cuhk.edu.hk/peoples/liao-wei-hsin/) from CUHK and Prof. [Qi Ge](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/?tagid=geq&iscss=1&snapid=1&orderby=date&go=1&lang=en) from SUSTech. My area of interest in research encompasses a broad range of topics in field of mechanical engineering, including 3D/4D printing, soft robotics, smart materials & structure. In the year 2022, I earned the Bachelor of Engineering degree in Mechanical Engineering from [Sichuan University - Pittsburgh Institute](https://scupi.scu.edu.cn/en/).
