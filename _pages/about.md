Hello! My name is Liuchao Jin. I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate in Mechanical & Automation Engineering at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html), under the supervision of Prof. [Wei-Hsin Liao](https://www4.mae.cuhk.edu.hk/peoples/liao-wei-hsin/). My research interests center on 3D/4D printing, smart materials & structures, meta-materials/structures, soft robotics, energy absorption, and energy harvesting. I'm the recipient of [Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme (HKPFS)](https://cerg1.ugc.edu.hk/hkpfs/index.html). I also act as visiting scholars at Southern University of Science and Technology and Shenzhen University. My academic journey began with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Mechanical Engineering from [Sichuan University - Pittsburgh Institute](https://scupi.scu.edu.cn/en/).
