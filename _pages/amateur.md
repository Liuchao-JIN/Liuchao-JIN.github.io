Welcome to the world of my amateur.

My Reading
======
* [Bodies That Matter: On the discursive limits of "sex"](http://Liuchao-JIN.github.io/files/amateur/Bodies_That_Matter__On_the_discursive_limits_of_sex.pdf)

My Video Production
======
* [Interstellar Remix](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1T7411U7xM/?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0&vd_source=2c30e5be5b16e81e5e9d55ca932d919b): The short film is composed of the classic science fiction work - "Interstellar" by Christopher Nolan and a short film with both visual effects and humanistic atmosphere - "Watchtower of Turkey" by Leonardo Dalessandri. The atmosphere is moving and sad and the colorfulness of "Watchtower of Turkey" is worthy of being the crystallization of two pinnacle works.
