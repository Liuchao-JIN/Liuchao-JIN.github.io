excerpt: 'Additive manufacturing (AM) has been continuously developed for more than 30 years. Different novel AM techniques, including electric-assisted, magnetic-assisted, robot-assisted, and UAV-assisted AM technologies have been created with various objectives. In this paper, we propose a new strategy for fabricating complex and/or multifunctional components of low-melting-point alloys (LMPA) using extrusion additive manufacturing (EAM). The main idea is using two nozzles in EAM, one for extruding polymers (e.g., PLA, PVA) while another for extruding LMPA. By using the proposed EAM system, there are three novel aspects of this study. First, the proposed system can achieve composite parts (polymer & LMPA) fabrication with improved mechanical properties. Second, the proposed system can be used to fabricate 3D products with LMPA wire inside acting as electrical wire. This achieves electrical wire inside a product without assembly, unlike conventional method which needs further step to insert the wires. Third, complex pure LMPA parts can be fabricated by dissolving the polymer after manufacturing, achieving complex LMPA parts fabrication using EAM (a low-cost AM technique, compared with traditional metal AM).'
