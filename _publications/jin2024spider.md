title: "Spider Web-Inspired Additive Manufacturing: Unleashing the Potential of Lightweight Support Structures"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/jin2024spider
excerpt: 'This paper explores the methodology for the utilization of spider web-inspired additive manufacturing to enhance overhang support structures in 3D printing. Inspired by the strength and flexibility of spider silk, we propose an approach that reduces material consumption and postprocessing efforts. The methodology includes 3D printing spider webs, addressing key questions on silk production, web strength, and printing path generation. Experimental results demonstrate substantial weight reduction in printed objects, showcasing the efficiency of spider web-inspired support compared to traditional methods. The potential applications extend to hollow shell printing and efficient mass production.'
