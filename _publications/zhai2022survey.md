title: "A survey of additive manufacturing reviews"

permalink: /publication/zhai2022survey
excerpt: 'Nowadays, additive manufacturing (AM) technologies have been widely used in construction, medical, military, aerospace, fashion, etc. The advantages of AM (eg, more design freedom, no restriction on the complexity of parts, and rapid prototyping) have attracted a growing number of researchers. Increasing number of papers are published each year. Until now, thousands of review papers have already been published in the field of AM. It is, therefore, perhaps timely to perform a survey on AM review papers so as to provide an overview and guidance for readers to choose their interested reviews on some specific topics. This survey gives detailed analysis on these reviews, divides these reviews into different groups based on the AM techniques and materials used, highlights some important reviews in this area, and provides some discussions and insights.'
