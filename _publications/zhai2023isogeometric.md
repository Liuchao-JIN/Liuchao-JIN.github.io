excerpt: 'Auxetic materials are a class of materials that exhibit a negative Poissonâ€™s ratio. They have held a major interest in academics and engineering focusing on finding the material distribution and examining the mechanisms, properties, and applications. Inverse homogenization theory is taken as an effective material design tool and has been applied to optimize various metamaterials. In this paper, we derive and implement the energy-based isogeometric homogenization to generate auxetic materials. Numerical examples show that the homogenized elasticity matrix obtained by the energy-based isogeometric homogenization method is almost the same as that obtained by the finite element homogenization method within a tolerated error. On this basis, we applied the isogeometric Moving Morphable Components (MMC) method to the optimization design of auxetic materials which is named the TOP-IGA-MMC method. We further make a comparison of the Solid Isotropic Material with the Penalization (SIMP) method and the TOP-IGA-MMC method in the geometries and properties of the final optimal auxetic materials. Parameter tests and physical tests are also introduced to verify the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method.'
