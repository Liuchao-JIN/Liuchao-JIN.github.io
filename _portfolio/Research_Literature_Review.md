* Codesign of Biobased Cellulose-Filled Filaments and Mesostructures for 4D Printing Humidity Responsive Smart Structures
  * Keywords: fused filament fabrication, biobased polymers, hygromorphs, material programming, adaptive architecture
  * Summary: The article discusses a new approach to 4D printing of hygromorphic smart structures that can respond to relative humidity (RH). Hygromorphic structures can autonomously change their shape in response to environmental changes in RH, and their applications include adaptive shading elements and weather-responsive building envelopes. Four-dimensional (4D) printing, which involves 3D printing of structures that can change their shape over time in response to external stimuli, is a suitable method for developing such structures. However, current material limitations in terms of printability, responsiveness, and mechanical properties are major bottlenecks in achieving reliable and repeatable humidity-responsive actuation. The article proposes a codesign method for 4D printing hygromorphic structures through fused filament fabrication, which involves the development of cellulose-filled filaments with varying stiffness and hygroresponsiveness and designed mesoscale structuring in printed elements. The prototypes developed in the study can fully transform in conditions of 35–90% RH, which corresponds to naturally occurring shifts in RH in daily and seasonal weather cycles, and their motion is fast, fully reversible, and repeatable in numerous cycles. The study demonstrates the potential of using 4D printing and natural resources for the development of functional humidity-responsive smart structures.

  * Summary: Cheng et al. developed an inverse design method to achieve complex three-dimensional (3D surfaces through a subset of 2D films that are bonded together. Analytic modeling and computations to inverse design the 2D patterns allow for control of the final porosity. A wide range of examples are provided, including changes in the sign of the curvature. These structures can be fabricated from silicon, metals, chitosan, and polymers.

* 4D Thermo-Responsive Smart hiPSC-CM Cardiac Construct for Myocardial Cell Therapy
  * Keywords: 4D printing, shape memory, nanostructure, myocardial regeneration, cellularized patch, minimally invasive
  * Summary: 4D fabrication techniques have been utilized for advanced biomedical therapeutics due to their ability to create dynamic constructs that can transform into desired shapes on demand. The internal structure of the human cardiovascular system is complex, where the contracting heart has a highly curved surface that changes shape with the heart’s dynamic beating motion. Hence, 4D architectures that adjust their shapes as required are a good candidate to readily deliver cardiac cells into the damaged heart and/or to serve as self-morphing tissue scaffolds/patches for healing cardiac diseases. In this proof-of-concept in vitro study, a two-in-one 4D smart cardiac construct that integrates the functions of minimally invasive cell vehicles and in situ tissue patches was developed for repairing damaged myocardial tissue.

* Tough PEGgels by In Situ Phase Separation for 4D Printing
  * Keywords: 4D printing, gels materials
  * Summary: Polymer gels, consisting of cross-linked polymer network systems swollen by a solvent, show great potential in biomedicine, flexible electronics, and artificial muscles, due to their tissue-like mechanical properties. Due to the presence of a large amount of solvent, the improvement of the mechanical properties of the polymer gel is a challenge. Moreover, combining high toughness with useful properties, such as 3D printability or shape-memory, in one polymer gel system is even more challenging. In this study, a simple and efficient method is developed for the fabrication of tough polymer gels by polymerizing 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) in a mixture of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and poly(propylene glycol) (PPG). The polymerized elastic networkpresents distinct compatibility with PEG (compatible) and PPG (poorly compatible), resulting in in-situ phase separation at the microscale. The resulting phase-separated gel demonstrates high strength (8.0 MPa), favorable fracture strain (430%), and large toughness (17.0 MJ m−3). The separated hard phasewith a high glass transition temperature (75 °C) endows the whole soft polymer gel with the property of shape memory at room temperature. Finally, the fabrication of tunable tough PEGgels is combined with 3D printing as well as with shape memory properties, demonstrating the use of PEGgels for 4D printing.

* 4D printing of multiple shape memory polymer and nanocomposites with biocompatible, programmable and selectively actuated properties
  * Keywords: 3 layer of SMP to control the shape change of materials continuously
  * Summary: 4D printing of poly (D,L-lactide-co-trimethylene carbonate) (PLMC)/poly (trimethylene carbonate) (PTMC)/Fe3O4 multi-material with multiple shape-changing capabilities under sequential stimuli of remotely magnetic field and heat was achieved. At first, we optimized the composition of pure SMP to fine tune the multiple shape memory effect and quantitatively characterized the shape recovery by stepwise heating. Then with the addition of Fe3O4 nanoparticles, the multi-material distribution of 4D printed structure consisting of multiple-SMP and its nanocomposites was designed. The integration of multi-material additive manufacturing with multiple shape memory effect extends the shape transformation to quintuple complex shapes with accurate and local controllability under selective multi-stimuli. The 4D printed multiple-SMP and its nanocomposites with simultaneously thermo- and magnetic- responsive shape-changing capability also demonstrated excellent biocompatibility. This work thus offers a feasible and robust approach for 4D printing of multi-functional devices for broad applications in entertainment, robotics, biomedical field and beyond.

* 4D Printing of Hydrogels: A Review
  * Keywords: 4D Printing, Hydrogels, review
  * Summary: 3D printing permits the construction of objects by layer-by-layer deposition of material, resulting in precise control of the dimensions and properties of complex printed structures. Although 3D printing fabricates inanimate objects, the emerging technology of 4D printing allows for animated structures that change their shape, function, or properties over time when exposed to specific external stimuli after fabrication. Among the materials used in 4D printing, hydrogels have attracted growing interest due to the availability of various smart hydrogels. The reversible shape-morphing in 4D printed hydrogel structures is driven by a stress mismatch arising from the different swelling degrees in the parts of the structure upon application of a stimulus. This review provides the state-of-the-art of 4D printing of hydrogels from the materials perspective. First, the main 3D printing technologies employed are briefly depicted, and, for each one, the required physico-chemical properties of the precursor material. Then, the hydrogels that have been printed are described, including stimuli-responsive hydrogels, non-responsive hydrogels that are sensitive to solvent absorption/desorption, and multimaterial structures that are totally hydrogel-based. Finally, the current and future applications of this technology are presented, and the requisites and avenues of improvement in terms of material properties are discussed.

* Hydrophilic/Hydrophobic Composite Shape-Shifting Structures
  * Keywords: active structures solvent-responsive structures digital light processing 3D printing 4D printing
  * Summary: Swelling-induced shape transformation has been widely investigated and applied to the design and fabrication of smart polymer devices, such as soft robotics, biomedical devices, and origami patterns. Previous shape-shifting designs using soft hydrogels have several limitations, including relatively small actuation force, slow responsive speed, and relatively complicated fabrication process. In this paper, we develop a novel hydrophilic/hydrophobic composite structure by using photopolymers. The rubbery nature of the materials used in this composite provides desirable actuation speed and actuation force. The photocurable polymer system could be easily patterned by using the digital light processing technique. Experiments and theoretical analysis were conducted to study the actuation process. We also fabricated several three-dimensional water-responsive shape-shifting structures, including structures with sequential actuation behavior. Finally, the directional bending behavior of the hydrophilic/hydrophobic bilayer plate was investigated.

* Responsive cellulose-hydrogel composite ink for 4D printing
  * Keywords: 4D materials, Additive manufacturing, Composite morphing, Stimuli-responsive, Cellulose-hydrogel
  * Summary: Sustainable and cost-effective solutions are crucial for the widespread adoption of 4D printing technology. This paper focuses on the development of a cellulose-hydrogel composite ink for additive manufacture, presenting the development and physical characterisation (stability, swelling potential and rheology) of the cellulose-hydrogel composite to establish its suitability for 4D printing of responsive structures. The use of a carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) hydrocolloid with incorporated cellulose pulp fibres resulted in an ink with a high total cellulose content (fibre volume fraction ≈50% for the dehydrated composite) and good dispersion of fibres within the hydrogel matrix. The composite ink formulation developed in this study permitted smooth extrusion using an open source 3D printer to achieve controlled material placement in 3D space while retaining the functionality of the cellulose. The addition of montmorillonite clay not only resulted in enhanced storage stability of the composite ink formulations but also had a beneficial effect on the extrusion characteristics. The ability to precisely apply the ink via 3D printing was demonstrated through fabrication of a complex structure capable of morphing according to pre-determined design rules in response to hydration/dehydration.

* Biomimetic 4D printing
  * Keywords: hydrogel 4D printing
  * Summary: Shape-morphing systems can be found in many areas, including smart textiles, autonomous robotics, biomedical devices, drug delivery and tissue engineering. The natural analogues of such systems are exemplified by nastic plant motions, where a variety of organs such as tendrils, bracts, leaves and flowers respond to environmental stimuli (such as humidity, light or touch) by varying internal turgor, which leads to dynamic conformations governed by the tissue composition and microstructural anisotropy of cell walls. Inspired by these botanical systems, we printed composite hydrogel architectures that are encoded with localized, anisotropic swelling behaviour controlled by the alignment of cellulose fibrils along prescribed four-dimensional printing pathways. When combined with a minimal theoretical framework that allows us to solve the inverse problem of designing the alignment patterns for prescribed target shapes, we can programmably fabricate plant-inspired architectures that change shape on immersion in water, yielding complex three-dimensional morphologies.

* Active Printed Materials for Complex Self-Evolving Deformations
  * Keywords: hydrogel 4D printing
  * Summary: We propose a new design of complex self-evolving structures that vary over time due to environmental interaction. In conventional 3D printing systems, materials are meant to be stable rather than active and fabricated models are designed and printed as static objects. Here, we introduce a novel approach for simulating and fabricating self-evolving structures that transform into a predetermined shape, changing property and function after fabrication. The new locally coordinated bending primitives combine into a single system, allowing for a global deformation which can stretch, fold and bend given environmental stimulus.

  * Keywords: 3D printing, soft robots
  * Summary: Polymer gels, such as hydrogels, have been widely used in biomedical applications, flexible electronics, and soft machines. Polymer network design and its contribution to the performance of gels has been extensively studied. In this study, the critical influence of the solvent nature on the mechanical properties and performance of soft polymer gels is demonstrated. A polymer gel platform based on poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) as solvent is reported (PEGgel). Compared to the corresponding hydrogel or ethylene glycol gel, the PEGgel with physically cross-linked poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate-co-acrylic acid) demonstrates high stretchability and toughness, rapid self-healing, and long-term stability. Depending on the molecular weight and fraction of PEG, the tensile strength of the PEGgels varies from 0.22 to 41.3 MPa, fracture strain from 12% to 4336%, modulus from 0.08 to 352 MPa, and toughness from 2.89 to 56.23 MJ m–3. Finally, rapid self-healing of the PEGgel is demonstrated and a self-healing pneumatic actuator is fabricated by 3D-printing. The enhanced mechanical properties of the PEGgel system may be extended to other polymer networks (both chemically and physically cross-linked). Such a simple 3D-printable, self-healing, and tough soft material holds promise for broad applications in wearable electronics, soft actuators and robotics.

* Rheological behaviour of different composite materials for additive manufacturing of 3D bone scaffolds
  * Keywords: Additive manufacturing, Polymer-ceramic blends, Printability, Rheology
  * Summary: The aim of the paper is the investigation of rheological behaviour of polymer and composite blends regularly used for the production of scaffolds for bone tissue applications with the use of additive manufacturing. Poly-ε-caprolactone (PCL), hydroxyapatite (HA), β-tri-calcium phosphate (TCP) and Bioglass 45S5 blends containing different ceramic concentrations (10wt%, 15wt% and 20wt%) were prepared with the use of melt blending procedure and investigated with the use of oscillation and rotational rheology tests. Results are showing that all blends are presenting viscoelastic behaviour with higher viscous modulus, compared with elastic modulus for low frequencies, with this difference reducing while the frequency is increasing. All blends are presenting shear-thinning behaviour suitable for use with additive manufacturing methods. Viscous and elastic modulus are increasing by adding ceramic particles. Results are presenting that PCL/HA blends of the same material concentration are presenting higher elastic modulus properties compared with the other blends, while PCL/Bioglass blends are presenting lower loss factor, lower relaxation time and lower shear viscosity making them easier to handle during the printing procedure.

* Multimaterial magnetically assisted 3D printing of composite materials
  * Keywords: DIW, make printing part have magnetical direction
  * Summary: 3D printing has become commonplace for the manufacturing of objects with unusual geometries. Recent developments that enabled printing of multiple materials indicate that the technology can potentially offer a much wider design space beyond unusual shaping. Here we show that a new dimension in this design space can be exploited through the control of the orientation of anisotropic particles used as building blocks during a direct ink-writing process. Particle orientation control is demonstrated by applying low magnetic fields on deposited inks pre-loaded with magnetized stiff platelets. Multimaterial dispensers and a two-component mixing unit provide additional control over the local composition of the printed material. The five-dimensional design space covered by the proposed multimaterial magnetically assisted 3D printing platform (MM-3D printing) opens the way towards the manufacturing of functional heterogeneous materials with exquisite microstructural features thus far only accessible by biological materials grown in nature.

* A self-healing nanocomposite double network bacterial nanocellulose/gelatin hydrogel for three dimensional printing
  * Keywords: self-healing nanocomposite, 3D printing hydrogel
  * Summary: Extrusion-based three-dimensional (3D) printing of gelatin is important for additive manufactured tissue engineering scaffolds, but gelatin's thermal instability has remained an ongoing challenge. The gelatin tends to suddenly collapse at mild temperatures, which is a significant limitation for using it at physiological temperature of 37 °C. Hence, fabrication of a thermo-processable gelatin hydrogel adapted for extrusion-based additive manufacturing is still a challenge. To achieve this, a self-healing nanocomposite double-network (ncDN) gelatin hydrogel was fabricated with high thermo-processability, shear-thinning, mechanical strength, self-healing, self-recovery, and biocompatibility. To do this, amino group-rich gelatin was first created by combining gelatin with carboxyl methyl chitosan. Afterwards, a self-healing ncDN gelatin hydrogel was formed via an in-situ formation of imine bonds between the blend of gelatin/carboxyl methyl chitosan (Gel/CMCh) and dialdehyde-functionalized bacterial nanocellulose (dBNC). dBNC plays as nanofiber cross-linkers capable of simultaneously crosslinking and reinforcing the double networks of Gel/CMCh through formation of dynamic 3D imine bonds. Based on our findings, our self-healing ncDA gelatin hydrogel displayed great potential as a promising ink for additive manufactured tissue engineering scaffolds.

  * Keywords: three-dimensional nanofabrication
  * Summary: There has been a compelling demand of fabricating high-resolution complex three-dimensional (3D) structures in nanotechnology. While two-photon lithography (TPL) largely satisfies the need since its introduction, its low writing speed and high cost make it impractical for many large-scale applications. We report a digital holography-based TPL platform that realizes parallel printing with up to 2000 individually programmable laser foci to fabricate complex 3D structures with 90 nm resolution. This effectively improves the fabrication rate to 2,000,000 voxels/sec. The promising result is enabled by the polymerization kinetics under a low-repetition-rate regenerative laser amplifier, where the smallest features are defined via a single laser pulse at 1 kHz. We have fabricated large-scale metastructures and optical devices of up to centimeter-scale to validate the predicted writing speed, resolution, and cost. The results confirm our method provides an effective solution for scaling up TPL for applications beyond laboratory prototyping.

* Ultrastrong and damage-tolerant ceramic architectures via 3D printing
  * Keywords: Damage tolerance, Ceramic architectures, 3D printing, Mechanical property, In situ compression
  * Summary: Ceramic materials have high mechanical strength and exceptional environmental stability, but are suboptimal for structural applications due to their inherent brittleness and low damage tolerance. Here, we report ultrastrong and damage-tolerant ceramic architectures that are designed based on Schwarz Primitive structures and manufactured by digital light processing (DLP)-based 3D printing. Through micro-computed tomography imaging and in situ compression experiments, we reveal that the step effect of 3D printing plays a role in crack initiation and propagation of the 3D-printed architectures. When the loading direction is perpendicular to the printing direction, the steps can induce cracks to propagate along the loading direction, which is beneficial to localize the cracks in the outer part of structure and enhance the structural strength and damage tolerance. After optimizing structural design and heat treatment process, the printed ceramic architecture can achieve compressive strength as high as 710 MPa at a relative density of 57.58 %. More importantly, the printed ceramic architecture exhibits excellent damage tolerance. It can bear more 20 cycles of 6 % compressive strain when 28 % of the structures have been damaged. The ceramic architecture can still bear the load without failure even when the degree of damage reaches 44 %. The superior mechanical properties make them have great potential in engineering applications that require high mechanical reliability.

* Centrifugal multimaterial 3D printing of multifunctional heterogeneous objects
  * Keywords: Multimaterial DLP
  * Summary: There are growing demands for multimaterial three-dimensional (3D) printing to manufacture 3D object where voxels with different properties and functions are precisely arranged. Digital light processing (DLP) is a high-resolution fast-speed 3D printing technology suitable for various materials. However, multimaterial 3D printing is challenging for DLP as the current multimaterial switching methods require direct contact onto the printed part to remove residual resin. Here we report a DLP-based centrifugal multimaterial (CM) 3D printing method to generate large-volume heterogeneous 3D objects where composition, property and function are programmable at voxel scale. Centrifugal force enables non-contact, high-efficiency multimaterial switching, so that the CM 3D printer can print heterogenous 3D structures in large area (up to 180 mm × 130 mm) made of materials ranging from hydrogels to functional polymers, and even ceramics. Our CM 3D printing method exhibits excellent capability of fabricating digital materials, soft robots, and ceramic devices.

* Multimaterial Three-Dimensional Printing of Ultraviolet-Curable Ionic Conductive Elastomers with Diverse Polymers for Multifunctional Flexible Electronics
  * Keywords: flexible electronics ionic conductive elastomers multimaterial 3D printing digital light processing 4D printing
  * Summary: Ionic conductive elastomers (ICEs) are emerging stretchable and ionic conductive materials that are solvent-free and thus demonstrate excellent thermal stability. Three-dimensional (3D) printing that creates complex 3D structures in free forms is considered as an ideal approach to manufacture sophisticated ICE-based devices. However, the current technologies constrain 3D printed ICE structures in a single material, which greatly limits functionality and performance of ICE-based devices and machines. Here, we report a digital light processing (DLP)-based multimaterial 3D printing capability to seemly integrate ultraviolet-curable ICE (UV-ICE) with nonconductive materials to create ionic flexible electronic devices in 3D forms with enhanced performance. This unique capability allows us to readily manufacture various 3D flexible electronic devices. To demonstrate this, we printed UV-ICE circuits into polymer substrates with different mechanical properties to create resistive strain and force sensors; we printed flexible capacitive sensors with high sensitivity (2 kPa–1) and a wide range of measured pressures (from 5 Pa to 550 kPa) by creating a complex microstructure in the dielectric layer; we even realized ionic conductor-activated four-dimensional (4D) printing by printing a UV-ICE circuit into a shape memory polymer substrate. The proposed approach paves a new efficient way to realize multifunctional flexible devices and machines by bonding ICEs with other polymers in 3D forms.

* Smart structures with embedded flexible sensors fabricated by fused deposition modeling-based multimaterial 3D printing
  * Keywords: 3D printing smart structures, flexible sensors
  * Summary: Smart structures have the advantages of high system integrity and diverse sensing capabilities. However, the labor-intensive and time-consuming fabrication process hinders the large-scale adoption of smart structures. Despite recent attempts to develop sensor-embedded structures using 3D printing technologies, the reported smart structures generally suffer from the complex fabrication process, constrained part size, and limited sensing modality. Herein, we propose a workflow to design and fabricate novel smart structures via multimaterial fused deposition modeling (FDM)-based 3D printing. More specifically, conductive filaments with tailorable mechanical and electrical properties, e.g. piezoresistive effects, were developed. Additionally, the printing process was optimized for processing soft filaments with Young’s modulus around 2 MPa, resolving the issue of filament buckling. Furthermore, the potential applications of the proposed workflow were showcased using three design cases, i.e. biaxial strain sensor, smart tire, and cable-driven soft finger with multiple sensing capabilities. This workflow provides a cost-effective and rapid solution for developing novel smart structures with soft materials.

  * Keywords: 3D printer development, Cryogenic additive manufacturing, Ice 3D printing, Multi-jet 3D printing
  * Summary: Multi-jet deposition of the materials is a matured technology used for graphic printing and 3 D printing for a wide range of materials. The multi-jet technology is fine-tuned for liquids with a specific range of viscosity and surface tension. However, the use of multi-jet for low viscosity fluids like water is not very popular. This paper aims to demonstrate the technique, particularly for the water-ice 3 D printing. 3 D printed ice parts can be used as patterns for investment casting, templates for microfluidic channel fabrication, support material for polymer 3 D printing, etc. Multi-jet ice 3 D printing is a novel technique for producing ice parts by selective deposition and freezing water layers. The paper confers the design, embodiment and integration of various subsystems of multi-jet ice 3 D printer. The outcomes of the machine trials are reported as case studies with elaborate details. The prismatic geometries are realized by ice 3 D printing. The accuracy of 0.1 mm is found in the build direction. The part height tends to increase due to volumetric expansion during the phase change. The present paper gives a novel architecture of the ice 3 D printer that produces the ice parts with good accuracy. The potential applications of the process are deliberated in this paper.

* Water/ice as sprayable sacrificial materials in low-temperature 3D printing for biomedical applications
  * Keywords: 3D printing, Additive manufacturing, Tissue engineering, Sacrificial process, Support structure, Low-temperature deposition
  * Summary: A spray-valve-based sacrificial process and “water/ice” support materials were developed in this study, based on the phase changes of water and low-temperature AM technology. The process entails utilizing the three phases of water to effectively and rapidly generate support structures that can also be efficiently removed completely after fabrication. Two scaffold materials, polycaprolactone-based waterborne polyurethane and chitosan, were tested. Moreover, ethanol or ethylene glycol was employed as the additive of pure water for facilitating the removal of excess support materials during fabrication. To verify the proposed sacrificial process, three complex and large scaffolds were fabricated, including a Y-type tubular scaffold, a square scaffold with dual inverted T-type inner channels, and a three-layer tapered scaffold. Results revealed that the properties of the printed complex structures were properly maintained and the adhesion between the layers was firm enough to resist elastic deformation.

* Freeform 3D Ice Printing (3D-ICE) at the Micro Scale
  * Keywords: 3D Ice Printing
  * Summary: Water is one of the most important elements for life on earth. Water's rapid phase-change ability along with its environmental and biological compatibility also makes it a unique structural material for 3D printing of ice structures reproducibly and accurately. This work introduces the freeform 3D ice printing (3D-ICE) process for high-speed and reproducible fabrication of ice structures with micro-scale resolution. Drop-on-demand deposition of water onto a −35 °C platform rapidly transforms water into ice. The dimension and geometry of the structures are critically controlled by droplet ejection frequency modulation and stage motions. The freeform approach obviates layer-by-layer construction and support structures, even for overhang geometries. Complex and overhang geometries, branched hierarchical structures with smooth transitions, circular cross-sections, smooth surfaces, and micro-scale features (as small as 50 µm) are demonstrated. As a sample application, the ice templates are used as sacrificial geometries to produce resin parts with well-defined internal features. This approach could bring exciting opportunities for microfluidics, biomedical devices, soft electronics, and art.

* Inkjet printing-based fabrication of microscale 3D ice structures
  * Keywords: microscale 3D printing ice structures
  * Summary: This study proposed a method for fabricating 3D microstructures of ice without a supporting material. The inkjet printing process was performed in a low humidity environment to precisely control the growth direction of the ice crystals. In the printing process, water droplets (volume = hundreds of picoliters) were deposited onto the previously formed ice structure, after which they immediately froze. Different 3D structures (maximum height = 2000 µm) could be formed by controlling the substrate temperature, ejection frequency and droplet size. The growth direction was dependent on the landing point of the droplet on the previously formed ice structure; thus, 3D structures could be created with high degrees of freedom.

  * Keywords:Nanotechnology, Nanofabrication, Electron-beam lithography, Ice lithography, 3D nanofabrication, Additive manufacturing, Organic ice
  * Summary: Nanotechnology and nanoscience are enabled by nanofabrication. Electron-beam lithography, which makes 2D patterns down to a few nanometers, is one of the fundamental pillars of nanofabrication. Recently, significant progress in 3D electron-beam-based nanofabrication has been made, such as the emerging ice lithography technology, in which ice thin-films are patterned by a focused electron-beam. Here, we review the history and progress of ice lithography, and focus on its applications in efficient 3D nanofabrication and additive manufacturing or nanoscale 3D printing. The finest linewidth made using frozen octane is below 5 nm, and nanostructures can be fabricated in selected areas on non-planar surfaces such as freely suspended nanotubes or nanowires. As developing custom instruments is required to advance this emerging technology, we discuss the evolution of ice lithography instruments and highlight major instrumentation advances. Finally, we present the perspectives of 3D printing of functional materials using organic ices. We believe that we barely scratched the surface of this new and exciting research area, and we hope that this review will stimulate cutting-edge and interdisciplinary research that exploits the undiscovered potentials of ice lithography for 3D photonics, electronics and 3D nanodevices for biology and medicine.

  * Summary: We report the successful application of a new approach, ice lithography (IL), to fabricate nanoscale devices. The entire IL process takes place inside a modified scanning electron microscope (SEM), where a vapor-deposited film of water ice serves as a resist for e-beam lithography, greatly simplifying and streamlining device fabrication. We show that labile nanostructures such as carbon nanotubes can be safely imaged in an SEM when coated in ice. The ice film is patterned at high e-beam intensity and serves as a mask for lift-off without the device degradation and contamination associated with e-beam imaging and polymer resist residues. We demonstrate the IL preparation of carbon nanotube field effect transistors with high-quality trans-conductance properties.

* Theoretical modeling of ice lithography on amorphous solid water
  * Keywords: ice lithography
  * Summary: Due to the perfection of the nanofabrication in nanotechnology and nanoscience, ice lithography (IL) by patterning ice thin-films with a focused electron beam, as a significant derivative technology of electron beam lithography (EBL), is attracting growing attention, evoked by its advantages over traditional EBL with respects of in situ-fabrication, high efficiency, high accuracy, limited proximity effect, three-dimensional (3D) profiling capability, etc. However, theoretical modeling of ice lithography for replicated profiles on the ice resist (amorphous solid water, ASW) has rarely been reported so far. As the result, the development of ice lithography still stays at the experimental stage. The shortage of modeling methods limits our insight into the ice lithography capability, as well as theoretical anticipations for future developments of this emerging technique. In this work, an e-beam induced etching ice model based on the Monte Carlo algorithm for point/line spread functions is established to calculate the replicated profiles of the resist by ice lithography. To testify the fidelity of the modeling method, systematic simulations of the ice lithography property under the processing parameters of the resist thickness, electron accelerating voltage and actual patterns are performed. Theoretical comparisons between the IL on ASW and the conventional EBL on polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) show superior properties of IL over EBL in terms of the minimum feature size, the highest aspect ratio, 3D nanostructure/devices, etc. The success in developing a modeling method for ice lithography, as reported in this paper, offers a powerful tool in characterizing ice lithography up to the theoretical level and down to molecular scales.

* Origami-based integration of robots that sense, decide, and respond
  * Keywords: origami robots by embedding sensing, computing, and actuating in compliant, conductive materials, without requiring semiconductor-based electronics
  * Summary: Origami-inspired engineering has enabled intelligent materials and structures to process and react to environmental stimuli. However, it is challenging to achieve complete sense-decide-act loops in origami materials for autonomous interaction with environments, mainly due to the lack of information processing units that can interface with sensing and actuation. Here, we introduce an integrated origami-based process to create autonomous robots by embedding sensing, computing, and actuating in compliant, conductive materials. By combining flexible bistable mechanisms and conductive thermal artificial muscles, we realize origami multiplexed switches and configure them to generate digital logic gates, memory bits, and thus integrated autonomous origami robots. We demonstrate with a flytrap-inspired robot that captures ‘living prey’, an untethered crawler that avoids obstacles, and a wheeled vehicle that locomotes with reprogrammable trajectories. Our method provides routes to achieve autonomy for origami robots through tight functional integration in compliant, conductive materials.

* On the Elastic Stability of Folded Rings in Circular and Straight States
  * Keywords: Folded Structures
  * Summary: Single-loop elastic rings can be folded into multi-loop equilibrium configurations. In this paper, the stability of several such multi-loop states which are either circular or straight are investigated analytically and illustrated by experimental demonstrations. The analysis ascertains stability by exploring variations of the elastic energy of the rings for admissible deformations in the vicinity of the equilibrium state. The approach employed is the conventional stability analysis for elastic conservative systems which differs from most of the analyses that have been published on this class of problems, as will be illustrated by reproducing and elaborating on several problems in the literature. In addition to providing solutions to two basic problems, the paper analyes and demonstrates the stability of six-sided rings that fold into straight configurations.

* Soft and lightweight fabric enables powerful and high-range pneumatic actuation
  * Keywords: a series of pneumatic actuators based on soft but less stretchable fabric, grasping force of over 150 N and a grasping range from 70 to 350 millimeters
  * Summary: Soft structures and actuation allow robots, conventionally consisting of rigid components, to perform more compliant, adaptive interactions similar to living creatures. Although numerous functions of these types of actuators have been demonstrated in the literature, their hyperelastic designs generally suffer from limited workspaces and load-carrying capabilities primarily due to their structural stretchability factor. Here, we describe a series of pneumatic actuators based on soft but less stretchable fabric that can simultaneously perform tunable workspace and bear a high payload. The motion mode of the actuator is programmable, combinable, and predictable and is informed by rapid response to low input pressure. A robotic gripper using three fabric actuators is also presented. The gripper demonstrates a grasping force of over 150 N and a grasping range from 70 to 350 millimeters. The design concept and comprehensive guidelines presented would provide design and analysis foundations for applying less stretchable yet soft materials in soft robots to further enhance their practicality.

* Predictive Learning of Error Recovery with a Sensorized Passivity-Based Soft Anthropomorphic Hand
  * Keywords: Soft robot sensing
  * Summary: Manipulation strategies based on the passive dynamics of soft-bodied interactions provide robust performances with limited sensory information. They utilize the kinematic structure and passive dynamics of the body to adapt to objects of varying shapes and properties. However, these soft passive interactions make the state of the robotic device influenced by the environment, making control generation and state estimation difficult. This work presents a closed-loop framework for dynamic interaction-based grasping that relies on two novelties: 1) a wrist-driven passive soft anthropomorphic hand that can generate robust grasp strategies using one-step kinaesthetic teaching and 2) a learning-based perception system that uses temporal data from sparse tactile sensors to predict and adapt to failures before it happens. With the anthropomorphic soft design and wrist-driven control, it is shown that controllers can be generated robust to novel objects and location uncertainty. With the learning-based high-level perception system and 32 sensing receptors, it is shown that failures can be predicted in advance, further improving the robustness of the entire system by more than doubling the grasping success rate. From over 1000 real-world grasping trials, both the control and perception framework are also seen to be transferable to novel objects and conditions.

* Self-folding soft-robotic chains with reconfigurable shapes and functionalities
  * Keywords: Magnetic continuum soft robot
  * Summary: Magnetic continuum soft robots can actively steer their tip under an external magnetic field, enabling them to effectively navigate in complex in vivo environments and perform minimally invasive interventions. However, the geometries and functionalities of these robotic tools are limited by the inner diameter of the supporting catheter as well as the natural orifices and access ports of the human body. Here, we present a class of magnetic soft-robotic chains (MaSoChains) that can self-fold into large assemblies with stable configurations using a combination of elastic and magnetic energies. By pushing and pulling the MaSoChain relative to its catheter sheath, repeated assembly and disassembly with programmable shapes and functions are achieved. MaSoChains are compatible with state-of-the-art magnetic navigation technologies and provide many desirable features and functions that are difficult to realize through existing surgical tools. This strategy can be further customized and implemented for a wide spectrum of tools for minimally invasive interventions.

* A versatile jellyfish-like robotic platform for effective underwater propulsion and manipulation
  * Keywords: jellyfish-like robotic fish, high against-gravity speed, low input power
  * Summary: Underwater devices are critical for environmental applications. However, existing prototypes typically use bulky, noisy actuators and limited configurations. Consequently, they struggle to ensure noise-free and gentle interactions with underwater species when realizing practical functions. Therefore, we developed a jellyfish-like robotic platform enabled by a synergy of electrohydraulic actuators and a hybrid structure of rigid and soft components. Our 16-cm-diameter noise-free prototype could control the fluid flow to propel while manipulating objects to be kept beneath its body without physical contact, thereby enabling safer interactions. Its against-gravity speed was up to 6.1 cm/s, substantially quicker than other examples in literature, while only requiring a low input power of around 100 mW. Moreover, using the platform, we demonstrated contact-based object manipulation, fluidic mixing, shape adaptation, steering, wireless swimming, and cooperation of two to three robots.

* Kirigami-Inspired 3D Printable Soft Pneumatic Actuators with Multiple Deformation Modes for Soft Robotic Applications
  * Keywords: 3D printing, soft robots, Kirigami
  * Summary: In this article, a new soft pneumatic actuator (SPA) is proposed taking inspiration from Kirigami. Kirigami-inspired cuts are applied to the actuator design, which enables the SPA to be equipped with multiple deformation modes. The proposed Kirigami-inspired soft pneumatic actuator (KiriSPA) is capable of producing bending motion, stretching motion, contraction motion, combined motion of bending and stretching, and combined motion of bending and contraction. The KiriSPA can be directly manufactured using 3D printers based on the fused deposition modeling technology. Finite element method is used to analyze and predict the deformation modes of the KiriSPA. We also investigated the step response, creep, hysteresis, actuation speed, stroke, workspace, stiffness, power density, and blocked force of the KiriSPA. Moreover, we demonstrated that KiriSPAs can be combined to expand the capabilities of various soft robotic systems including the soft robotic gripper for delicate object manipulation, the soft planar robotic manipulator for picking objects in the confined environment, the quadrupedal soft crawling robot, and the soft robot with the flipping locomotion.

* A stretchable wireless wearable bioelectronic system for multiplexed monitoring and combination treatment of infected chronic wounds
  * Keywords: wearable bioelectronic system
  * Summary: Chronic nonhealing wounds are one of the major and rapidly growing clinical complications all over the world. Current therapies frequently require emergent surgical interventions, while abuse and misapplication of therapeutic drugs often lead to an increased morbidity and mortality rate. Here, we introduce a wearable bioelectronic system that wirelessly and continuously monitors the physiological conditions of the wound bed via a custom-developed multiplexed multimodal electrochemical biosensor array and performs noninvasive combination therapy through controlled anti-inflammatory antimicrobial treatment and electrically stimulated tissue regeneration. The wearable patch is fully biocompatible, mechanically flexible, stretchable, and can conformally adhere to the skin wound throughout the entire healing process. Real-time metabolic and inflammatory monitoring in a series of preclinical in vivo experiments showed high accuracy and electrochemical stability of the wearable patch for multiplexed spatial and temporal wound biomarker analysis. The combination therapy enabled substantially accelerated cutaneous chronic wound healing in a rodent model.

* Investigating the effect of surface protrusions on galloping energy harvesting Editor’s Pick
  * Keywords: piezoelectric energy harvester
  * Summary: This Letter explores the potential effect of implementing different surface protrusions on galloping energy harvesters. Three types of protruded bluff bodies with rectangular, triangular, and elliptical metasurfaces are proposed, and four kinds of surface treatments are deployed to vary their protruded shape. Wind tunnel experiments reveal that adding the protrusions can obviously change the mode of oscillations, and only the backward protrusions can enhance the galloping response. Both the experiments and simulations show that elliptical surface protrusions have the greatest potential to enhance the galloping energy harvesting performance. Specifically, with a backward protruded length of 15 mm, the maximum output power in the experiments is measured to be 0.757 mW, which occurs at 5.1 m/s, and an optimal load resistance of 300 kΩ. In this case, the energy harvester outperforms its counterpart carrying a simple square prism by 157.48%.

* Tailorable activation of thermoresponsive composite structures incorporating wavy heaters via hybrid manufacturing
  * Keywords: Joule-heating, Tailorable activation of smart materials, Shape-memory polymers, Thermoresponsive composite structures
  * Summary: Herein, we present a concept of embedding a wavy heater into a thermoresponsive material matrix to form a composite structure with parametrically designed thermal activation behavior, through a facile manufacturing approach combining 3D-printing and laser-cutting. We develop a numerical model to predict the transient heat transfer for varying wavy shapes of heater, and experimentally validate the numerical results. The exploration of the design space using the numerical model shows a reduction of up to 82% in heating time using the wavy design compared with the flat design. Finally, we demonstrate experimentally the stiffness tuning in thermoresponsive composite structures. This work paves the way for large-scale thermoresponsive composite structures with applications in aerospace and architecture.

Metamaterials
=====
* Mechanical metamaterials made of freestanding quasi-BCC nanolattices of gold and copper with ultra-high energy absorption capacity
  * Keywords: Mechanical metamaterials, ultra-high energy absorption capacity, nm-scale manufacturing & testing
  * Summary: Nanolattices exhibit attractive mechanical properties such as high strength, high specific strength, and high energy absorption. However, at present, such materials cannot achieve effective fusion of the above properties and scalable production, which hinders their applications in energy conversion and other fields. Herein, we report gold and copper quasi-body centered cubic (quasi-BCC) nanolattices with the diameter of the nanobeams as small as 34 nm. We show that the compressive yield strengths of quasi-BCC nanolattices even exceed those of their bulk counterparts, despite their relative densities below 0.5. Simultaneously, these quasi-BCC nanolattices exhibit ultrahigh energy absorption capacities, i.e., 100 ± 6 MJ m−3 for gold quasi-BCC nanolattice and 110 ± 10 MJ m−3 for copper quasi-BCC nanolattice. Finite element simulations and theoretical calculations reveal that the deformation of quasi-BCC nanolattice is dominated by nanobeam bending. And the anomalous energy absorption capacities substantially stem from the synergy of the naturally high mechanical strength and plasticity of metals, the size reduction-induced mechanical enhancement, and the quasi-BCC nanolattice architecture. Since the sample size can be scaled up to macroscale at high efficiency and affordable cost, the quasi-BCC nanolattices with ultrahigh energy absorption capacity reported in this work may find great potentials in heat transfer, electric conduction, catalysis applications.

* Multimaterial 3D printed self-locking thick-panel origami metamaterials
  * Keywords: 3D self-locking thick-panel origami structure
  * Summary: Thick-panel origami has shown great potential in engineering applications. However, the thick-panel origami created by current design methods cannot be readily adopted to structural applications due to the inefficient manufacturing methods. Here, we report a design and manufacturing strategy for creating thick-panel origami structures with excellent foldability and capability of withstanding cyclic loading. We directly print thick-panel origami through a single fused deposition modeling (FDM) multimaterial 3D printer following a wrapping-based fabrication strategy where the rigid panels are wrapped and connected by highly stretchable soft parts. Through stacking two thick-panel origami panels into a predetermined configuration, we develop a 3D self-locking thick-panel origami structure that deforms by following a push-to-pull mode enabling the origami structure to support a load over 11000 times of its own weight and sustain more than 100 cycles of 40% compressive strain. After optimizing geometric parameters through a self-built theoretical model, we demonstrate that the mechanical response of the self-locking thick-panel origami structure is highly programmable, and such multi-layer origami structure can have a substantially improved impact energy absorption for various structural applications.

  Topology Optimization
  =====
  * Interactive Structural Topology Optimization with Subjective Scoring and Drawing Systems
    * Keywords: Topology optimization, Subjective preferences, Scoring, Drawing, Structural design
    * Summary: Topology optimization techniques can create efficient and innovative structural designs by redistributing underutilized materials to the most-needed locations. These techniques are typically performed based purely on structural performance without considering factors like aesthetics and other design requirements. Hence, the obtained structural designs may not be suitable for specific practical applications. This study presents a new topology optimization method, SP-BESO, by considering the subjective preferences (SP) of the designer. Here, subjective scoring and drawing systems are introduced into the popular bi-directional evolutionary structural optimization (BESO) technique. The proposed SP-BESO method allows users to iteratively and interactively create topologically different and structurally efficient solutions by explicitly scoring and drawing their subjective preferences. Hence, users do not need to passively accept the optimization results. A user-friendly digital design tool, iBESO, is developed, which contains four optimizers to simultaneously perform the proposed SP-BESO method to assist in the design exploration task. A variety of 2D examples are tested using the iBESO software to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SP-BESO method. It is found that the combination of parameters used in the scoring and drawing systems controls the formation of final structural topologies toward performance-driven or preference-driven designs. The utilization of the proposed SP-BESO method in potential practical applications is also demonstrated.
