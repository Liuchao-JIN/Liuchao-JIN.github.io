* Codesign of Biobased Cellulose-Filled Filaments and Mesostructures for 4D Printing Humidity Responsive Smart Structures
  * Keywords: fused filament fabrication, biobased polymers, hygromorphs, material programming, adaptive architecture
  * Summary: The article discusses a new approach to 4D printing of hygromorphic smart structures that can respond to relative humidity (RH). Hygromorphic structures can autonomously change their shape in response to environmental changes in RH, and their applications include adaptive shading elements and weather-responsive building envelopes. Four-dimensional (4D) printing, which involves 3D printing of structures that can change their shape over time in response to external stimuli, is a suitable method for developing such structures. However, current material limitations in terms of printability, responsiveness, and mechanical properties are major bottlenecks in achieving reliable and repeatable humidity-responsive actuation. The article proposes a codesign method for 4D printing hygromorphic structures through fused filament fabrication, which involves the development of cellulose-filled filaments with varying stiffness and hygroresponsiveness and designed mesoscale structuring in printed elements. The prototypes developed in the study can fully transform in conditions of 35–90% RH, which corresponds to naturally occurring shifts in RH in daily and seasonal weather cycles, and their motion is fast, fully reversible, and repeatable in numerous cycles. The study demonstrates the potential of using 4D printing and natural resources for the development of functional humidity-responsive smart structures.

* 4D Thermo-Responsive Smart hiPSC-CM Cardiac Construct for Myocardial Cell Therapy
  * Keywords: 4D printing, shape memory, nanostructure, myocardial regeneration, cellularized patch, minimally invasive
  * Summary: 4D fabrication techniques have been utilized for advanced biomedical therapeutics due to their ability to create dynamic constructs that can transform into desired shapes on demand. The internal structure of the human cardiovascular system is complex, where the contracting heart has a highly curved surface that changes shape with the heart’s dynamic beating motion. Hence, 4D architectures that adjust their shapes as required are a good candidate to readily deliver cardiac cells into the damaged heart and/or to serve as self-morphing tissue scaffolds/patches for healing cardiac diseases. In this proof-of-concept in vitro study, a two-in-one 4D smart cardiac construct that integrates the functions of minimally invasive cell vehicles and in situ tissue patches was developed for repairing damaged myocardial tissue.

* Tough PEGgels by In Situ Phase Separation for 4D Printing
  * Keywords: 4D printing, gels materials
  * Summary: Polymer gels, consisting of cross-linked polymer network systems swollen by a solvent, show great potential in biomedicine, flexible electronics, and artificial muscles, due to their tissue-like mechanical properties. Due to the presence of a large amount of solvent, the improvement of the mechanical properties of the polymer gel is a challenge. Moreover, combining high toughness with useful properties, such as 3D printability or shape-memory, in one polymer gel system is even more challenging. In this study, a simple and efficient method is developed for the fabrication of tough polymer gels by polymerizing 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) in a mixture of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and poly(propylene glycol) (PPG). The polymerized elastic networkpresents distinct compatibility with PEG (compatible) and PPG (poorly compatible), resulting in in-situ phase separation at the microscale. The resulting phase-separated gel demonstrates high strength (8.0 MPa), favorable fracture strain (430%), and large toughness (17.0 MJ m−3). The separated hard phasewith a high glass transition temperature (75 °C) endows the whole soft polymer gel with the property of shape memory at room temperature. Finally, the fabrication of tunable tough PEGgels is combined with 3D printing as well as with shape memory properties, demonstrating the use of PEGgels for 4D printing.

* 4D printing of multiple shape memory polymer and nanocomposites with biocompatible, programmable and selectively actuated properties
  * Keywords: 3 layer of SMP to control the shape change of materials continuously
  * Summary: 4D printing of poly (D,L-lactide-co-trimethylene carbonate) (PLMC)/poly (trimethylene carbonate) (PTMC)/Fe3O4 multi-material with multiple shape-changing capabilities under sequential stimuli of remotely magnetic field and heat was achieved. At first, we optimized the composition of pure SMP to fine tune the multiple shape memory effect and quantitatively characterized the shape recovery by stepwise heating. Then with the addition of Fe3O4 nanoparticles, the multi-material distribution of 4D printed structure consisting of multiple-SMP and its nanocomposites was designed. The integration of multi-material additive manufacturing with multiple shape memory effect extends the shape transformation to quintuple complex shapes with accurate and local controllability under selective multi-stimuli. The 4D printed multiple-SMP and its nanocomposites with simultaneously thermo- and magnetic- responsive shape-changing capability also demonstrated excellent biocompatibility. This work thus offers a feasible and robust approach for 4D printing of multi-functional devices for broad applications in entertainment, robotics, biomedical field and beyond.

* Tough, Transparent, 3D-Printable, and Self-Healing Poly(ethylene glycol)-Gel (PEGgel)
  * Keywords: 3D printing, soft robots
  * Summary: Polymer gels, such as hydrogels, have been widely used in biomedical applications, flexible electronics, and soft machines. Polymer network design and its contribution to the performance of gels has been extensively studied. In this study, the critical influence of the solvent nature on the mechanical properties and performance of soft polymer gels is demonstrated. A polymer gel platform based on poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) as solvent is reported (PEGgel). Compared to the corresponding hydrogel or ethylene glycol gel, the PEGgel with physically cross-linked poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate-co-acrylic acid) demonstrates high stretchability and toughness, rapid self-healing, and long-term stability. Depending on the molecular weight and fraction of PEG, the tensile strength of the PEGgels varies from 0.22 to 41.3 MPa, fracture strain from 12% to 4336%, modulus from 0.08 to 352 MPa, and toughness from 2.89 to 56.23 MJ m–3. Finally, rapid self-healing of the PEGgel is demonstrated and a self-healing pneumatic actuator is fabricated by 3D-printing. The enhanced mechanical properties of the PEGgel system may be extended to other polymer networks (both chemically and physically cross-linked). Such a simple 3D-printable, self-healing, and tough soft material holds promise for broad applications in wearable electronics, soft actuators and robotics.

Soft Robotics
======
* Origami-based integration of robots that sense, decide, and respond
  * Keywords: origami robots by embedding sensing, computing, and actuating in compliant, conductive materials, without requiring semiconductor-based electronics
  * Summary: Origami-inspired engineering has enabled intelligent materials and structures to process and react to environmental stimuli. However, it is challenging to achieve complete sense-decide-act loops in origami materials for autonomous interaction with environments, mainly due to the lack of information processing units that can interface with sensing and actuation. Here, we introduce an integrated origami-based process to create autonomous robots by embedding sensing, computing, and actuating in compliant, conductive materials. By combining flexible bistable mechanisms and conductive thermal artificial muscles, we realize origami multiplexed switches and configure them to generate digital logic gates, memory bits, and thus integrated autonomous origami robots. We demonstrate with a flytrap-inspired robot that captures ‘living prey’, an untethered crawler that avoids obstacles, and a wheeled vehicle that locomotes with reprogrammable trajectories. Our method provides routes to achieve autonomy for origami robots through tight functional integration in compliant, conductive materials.

* On the Elastic Stability of Folded Rings in Circular and Straight States
  * Keywords: Folded Structures
  * Summary: Single-loop elastic rings can be folded into multi-loop equilibrium configurations. In this paper, the stability of several such multi-loop states which are either circular or straight are investigated analytically and illustrated by experimental demonstrations. The analysis ascertains stability by exploring variations of the elastic energy of the rings for admissible deformations in the vicinity of the equilibrium state. The approach employed is the conventional stability analysis for elastic conservative systems which differs from most of the analyses that have been published on this class of problems, as will be illustrated by reproducing and elaborating on several problems in the literature. In addition to providing solutions to two basic problems, the paper analyes and demonstrates the stability of six-sided rings that fold into straight configurations.

* A stretchable wireless wearable bioelectronic system for multiplexed monitoring and combination treatment of infected chronic wounds
  * Keywords: wearable bioelectronic system
  * Summary: Chronic nonhealing wounds are one of the major and rapidly growing clinical complications all over the world. Current therapies frequently require emergent surgical interventions, while abuse and misapplication of therapeutic drugs often lead to an increased morbidity and mortality rate. Here, we introduce a wearable bioelectronic system that wirelessly and continuously monitors the physiological conditions of the wound bed via a custom-developed multiplexed multimodal electrochemical biosensor array and performs noninvasive combination therapy through controlled anti-inflammatory antimicrobial treatment and electrically stimulated tissue regeneration. The wearable patch is fully biocompatible, mechanically flexible, stretchable, and can conformally adhere to the skin wound throughout the entire healing process. Real-time metabolic and inflammatory monitoring in a series of preclinical in vivo experiments showed high accuracy and electrochemical stability of the wearable patch for multiplexed spatial and temporal wound biomarker analysis. The combination therapy enabled substantially accelerated cutaneous chronic wound healing in a rodent model.
