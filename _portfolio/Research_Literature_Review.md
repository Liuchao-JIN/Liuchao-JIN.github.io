4D Printing
======
* Codesign of Biobased Cellulose-Filled Filaments and Mesostructures for 4D Printing Humidity Responsive Smart Structures
  * Keywords: fused filament fabrication, biobased polymers, hygromorphs, material programming, adaptive architecture
  * Summary: The article discusses a new approach to 4D printing of hygromorphic smart structures that can respond to relative humidity (RH). Hygromorphic structures can autonomously change their shape in response to environmental changes in RH, and their applications include adaptive shading elements and weather-responsive building envelopes. Four-dimensional (4D) printing, which involves 3D printing of structures that can change their shape over time in response to external stimuli, is a suitable method for developing such structures. However, current material limitations in terms of printability, responsiveness, and mechanical properties are major bottlenecks in achieving reliable and repeatable humidity-responsive actuation. The article proposes a codesign method for 4D printing hygromorphic structures through fused filament fabrication, which involves the development of cellulose-filled filaments with varying stiffness and hygroresponsiveness and designed mesoscale structuring in printed elements. The prototypes developed in the study can fully transform in conditions of 35–90% RH, which corresponds to naturally occurring shifts in RH in daily and seasonal weather cycles, and their motion is fast, fully reversible, and repeatable in numerous cycles. The study demonstrates the potential of using 4D printing and natural resources for the development of functional humidity-responsive smart structures.

* Programming 3D curved mesosurfaces using microlattice designs
  * Keywords: Rational inverse design of 3D shapes
  * Summary: Cheng et al. developed an inverse design method to achieve complex three-dimensional (3D surfaces through a subset of 2D films that are bonded together. Analytic modeling and computations to inverse design the 2D patterns allow for control of the final porosity. A wide range of examples are provided, including changes in the sign of the curvature. These structures can be fabricated from silicon, metals, chitosan, and polymers.

Soft Robotics
======
* Origami-based integration of robots that sense, decide, and respond
  * Keywords: origami robots by embedding sensing, computing, and actuating in compliant, conductive materials, without requiring semiconductor-based electronics
  * Summary: Origami-inspired engineering has enabled intelligent materials and structures to process and react to environmental stimuli. However, it is challenging to achieve complete sense-decide-act loops in origami materials for autonomous interaction with environments, mainly due to the lack of information processing units that can interface with sensing and actuation. Here, we introduce an integrated origami-based process to create autonomous robots by embedding sensing, computing, and actuating in compliant, conductive materials. By combining flexible bistable mechanisms and conductive thermal artificial muscles, we realize origami multiplexed switches and configure them to generate digital logic gates, memory bits, and thus integrated autonomous origami robots. We demonstrate with a flytrap-inspired robot that captures ‘living prey’, an untethered crawler that avoids obstacles, and a wheeled vehicle that locomotes with reprogrammable trajectories. Our method provides routes to achieve autonomy for origami robots through tight functional integration in compliant, conductive materials.
