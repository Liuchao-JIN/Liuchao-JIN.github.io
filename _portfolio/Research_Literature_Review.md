* Codesign of Biobased Cellulose-Filled Filaments and Mesostructures for 4D Printing Humidity Responsive Smart Structures
  * Keywords: fused filament fabrication, biobased polymers, hygromorphs, material programming, adaptive architecture
  * Summary: The article discusses a new approach to 4D printing of hygromorphic smart structures that can respond to relative humidity (RH). Hygromorphic structures can autonomously change their shape in response to environmental changes in RH, and their applications include adaptive shading elements and weather-responsive building envelopes. Four-dimensional (4D) printing, which involves 3D printing of structures that can change their shape over time in response to external stimuli, is a suitable method for developing such structures. However, current material limitations in terms of printability, responsiveness, and mechanical properties are major bottlenecks in achieving reliable and repeatable humidity-responsive actuation. The article proposes a codesign method for 4D printing hygromorphic structures through fused filament fabrication, which involves the development of cellulose-filled filaments with varying stiffness and hygroresponsiveness and designed mesoscale structuring in printed elements. The prototypes developed in the study can fully transform in conditions of 35â€“90% RH, which corresponds to naturally occurring shifts in RH in daily and seasonal weather cycles, and their motion is fast, fully reversible, and repeatable in numerous cycles. The study demonstrates the potential of using 4D printing and natural resources for the development of functional humidity-responsive smart structures.

* Programming 3D curved mesosurfaces using microlattice designs
  * Keywords: Rational inverse design of 3D shapes
  * Summary: Cheng et al. developed an inverse design method to achieve complex three-dimensional (3D surfaces through a subset of 2D films that are bonded together. Analytic modeling and computations to inverse design the 2D patterns allow for control of the final porosity. A wide range of examples are provided, including changes in the sign of the curvature. These structures can be fabricated from silicon, metals, chitosan, and polymers.
